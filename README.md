### The Frog Problem
##### Presented by Timandra Harkness and Matt Parker in [Can you solve The Frog Problem?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLTyX4zL2Fc)
Imagine some number of lillypads spanning a river, and a frog at one bank. The frog wants to cross the river. To jump forward, it randomly selects a lillypad (or the far bank) from the available ones ahead of it with equal probability, jumps there, and repeats this process until it has reached the opposite bank.

For a given number of lillypads n, what is the expected (average) number of jumps for the frog to make it to the opposite bank?
